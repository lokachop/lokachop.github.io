				A week ago, I finally decided to move to Linux, since I've been planning to since I got my new computer around 2 years ago, here's my overall thoughts and experience with it
				</p>

				<p>
				I was originally planning to use <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian 12</a> for my OS, but due to some weird GPU driver issues, I ended up switching to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a><br>
				I now know that the driver issues were caused by using the <code>nvidia-open</code> drivers instead of the <code>nvidia</code> drivers...<br>
				The lesson of the story is, don't buy NVidia if you plan to use Linux!
				</p>

				<ul class="coolerul">
					<h3>Installation</h3>
					<li>I used archinstall, because I can't be asked to follow the ten-thousand steps to set up the OS while I could just follow a nice TermUI</li>
					<li>I set up a separate partition on a separate drive for my <code>/home</code> folder, in case I ever want to distro hop to something else</li>
					<li>For the DE, I decided to go with KDE Plasma, since I've practically always used it <i class="smallitalic"> even back in school!</i> and because it feels the closest to Windows</li>
					<li>I initially used the <code>nvidia-open</code> drivers, but later ended up using the <code>nvidia</code> drivers due to issues I'll mention later on</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="coolerul">
					<h3>Initial Issues</h3>
					<li>After first installing and properly booting, I had random freezing every minute or so, although audio kept playing<br>
					I'm not too certain as to how I solved it or why it kept happening, but I assume it was something GPU-driver related<br>
					<i class="smallitalic">probably caused by <code>nvidia-open</code>!</i>, as it stopped when I installed the <code>nvidia</code> drivers instead</li>

					<li>Vulkan support was completely broken on the <code>nvidia-open</code> drivers, which lead to games running under proton crashing near instantly<br>
					and to horrible graphical artifacts when running under OpenGL</li>

					<li>As soon as I installed the <code>nvidia</code> drivers, my primary display would stay off unless it's refresh rate was capped under 120<br>
					I fixed this via switching out the cable from HDMI to DisplayPort <i class="smallitalic">which funnily enough, was giving me issues on Windows!</i></li>

					<li>My second monitor would freeze on the same frame until I reconnected it very rarely <i class="smallitalic">it only happened once while playing AnIV</i><br>
					I still don't know why it happened, and it has not happened ever since</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="coolerul">
					<h3>Stuff I Miss</h3>
					<li>Holding down MMB to scroll with the mouse, thankfully, Firefox has support for it! <i class="smallitalic">just enable autoscroll in settings</i></li>
					
					<li><a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a>, there are very good alternatives but I mostly miss the other tools ShareX provided, like screen colour picking and GIF recording</li>
					
					<li>Random Windows-only tools like Wavosaur, Thankfully, this isn't a problem thanks to <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">wine!</a></li>
					
					<li>One or two games that used bad anticheat solutions that don't support Linux <i class="smallitalic">(GTA V Online)</i></li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="coolerul">
					<h3>Stuff I Find Better</h3>
					<li>Memory usage, you compare it to Windows and the difference is absurd!<br>
					At the moment of writing this, I have Discord, Firefox, VSCodium, npx http-server and Steam open, and it's only using 6GiB!<br>
					Meanwhile, my old Windows install would idle at 8GiB+</li>
		
					<li>The package manager, the fact that Windows doesn't have anything similar is pretty sad, it is one command to get most if not all programs!<br>
					I guess the only confusing part of it is the divide of AUR packages and normal <code>pacman</code> packages</li>
			
					<li>Updates are simpler to install, and you're not forced to install them until you ACTUALLY want them</li>

					<li>Building programs is way simpler and less of a nightmare than on Windows</li>

					<li>The shell doesn't feel like an afterthought, it actually feels nice to use, more so if you use a custom shell like <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>!</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="coolerul">
					<h3>Stuff That Surprised Me</h3>
					<li>Most if not all games that I play work without any sort of hard work to set up!<br>
					I would personally say the best candidates are <a href="https://spacestation14.com/">Space Station 14</a> and Minecraft<br>
					Proton also contributes A LOT to this, making 99% of Windows-only games work perfectly!</li>
					
					<li>The amount of guides and tutorials is surprising, I was expecting finding help very hard!</li>

					<li>99% of the software I already was using is here too!</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="coolerul">
					<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
					Even if the process has been bumpy, i'm still really thankful to be off Windows now, it is something I have always been meaning to do but<br>
					never really got to due to fearing data loss, thankfully thanks to a recently obtained NAS that is no longer a concern!<br>
					I'm also really happy to see more developers taking Linux support seriously thanks to the Steam Deck, specially Valve!<br>
					<br>
					<i class="smallitalic">and here's the mandatory neofetch</i><br>
